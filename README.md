This is a fresh expo-router setup.
This is not coming from a monorepo.
This is just a clean stup without any additonal libs.

In oreder to run this project just follow the default set of commands from the official expo documentation.

1. Install all deps
```
yarn install
```

2. Prebuild and run the project on iOS
```
npx expo prebuild --clean && npx expo run:ios
```


3. Publish the updates. EXPO TEAM - you will have to change the app.json config to match your own internal setup, since I can't give out my account obviously, and the project is in unlisted state, maybe EAS updates will be visible for you in the expo dev client build inside a simulator.
